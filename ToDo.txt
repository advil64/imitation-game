1) Pick an Agent from project 1 and 2
    - Agent 1
    - Agent 3
2) Copy over any relevant code
    - Can copy over from just Project 2
3) Generate data using the selected Agents
    - Agent 1
        - For each step in the execution:
            - Record in a file the discovered_grid, current position, which direction Agent 1 moved (up,down,left,right)
    - Agent 3
        - For each step in the execution:
            - Record in a file the discovered_grid, block_sense info, current position, which direction Agent 1 moved (up,down,left,right)
    - Repeat with as many boards to generate enough data
4) Create Neural Networks
    - Follow Prof. Cowan's Tensorflow tutorials to create the neural network
    - Train the neural network with the corresponding data files made in step 3
    - Adjust number of layers, number of nodes in each layer, activation function, loss function, and optimizer appropriately
    - Test Agent against their counterpart and record details like trajectory length, number of bumps, etc
5) Create CNN
    - Follow Prof. Cowan's Tensorflow tutorials to create the CNN
    - Train the neural network with the corresponding data files made in step 3
    - Adjust number of layers, number of nodes in each layer, activation function, loss function, optimizer, filter/feature, window size, and stride length appropriately
    - Test Agent against their counterpart and record details like trajectory length, number of bumps, etc
